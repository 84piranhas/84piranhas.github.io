The astonishing increase of value of the <a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-us/prices/xbt-bitcoin-price-chart/usd-us-dollar?interval=All" target="_blank">Bitcoin vs. the US Dollar</a> at the end of 2020 makes appear some discussions, reliefs and regrets about the past few years and the missed opportunities. Numerous threads on the social networks are about TO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodl" target="_blank">HODL</a> or not TO HODL.


The purpose of this article is to propose a view on a very basic strategy of investment in a volatile asset: the **dollar-cost averaging (DCA)**, i.e. invest the same amount of dollars in bitcoin on a periodic basis regardless its price.

## The method

> invest the same amount of dollars in bitcoin on a **weekly** basis
>> at the close (fictive) of the second working day, *Tuesday* (arbitrary choice)  
>> start at the *first week of the year*  
>> end at the *last week of the year*  
>> amount : **50 dollars**, as 10 dollars for each working day

> compare with the amount put in a bank account instead (0% interest)
