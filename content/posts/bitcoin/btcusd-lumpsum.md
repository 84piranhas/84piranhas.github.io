The astonishing increase of value of the <a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-us/prices/xbt-bitcoin-price-chart/usd-us-dollar?interval=All" target="_blank">Bitcoin vs. the US Dollar</a> at the end of 2020 makes appear some discussions, reliefs and regrets about the past few years and the missed opportunities. Numerous threads on the social networks are about TO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodl" target="_blank">HODL</a> or not TO HODL.

After describing both <a href="../btcusd-dca" target="_blank">DCA</a> and <a href="../btcusd-dva" target="_blank">DVA</a> strategies, we check the case of the very simple **lump-sum investing**, i.e. invest the total amount of dollars at once.

## The method

> invest the total amount of dollars in bitcoin at once
>> at the close (fictive) of the second working day of the year, *Tuesday*  
>> amount : **2600 dollars**, as 50 dollars by week (as 10 dollars for each working day)

> compare with the amount put in a bank account instead (0% interest)
