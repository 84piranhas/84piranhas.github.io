The astonishing increase of value of the <a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-us/prices/xbt-bitcoin-price-chart/usd-us-dollar?interval=All" target="_blank">Bitcoin vs. the US Dollar</a> at the end of 2020 makes appear some discussions, reliefs and regrets about the past few years and the missed opportunities. Numerous threads on the social networks are about TO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodl" target="_blank">HODL</a> or not TO HODL.

After describing the <a href="../btcusd-dca" target="_blank">DCA investment strategy</a>, we can propose another basic strategy of investment: the **dollar-value averaging (DVA)**, i.e. invest an amount of dollars in bitcoins on a periodic basis, amount based on a predefined target in dollars regarless of market fluctuations.

2 versions exist of this method:
1. the investment cannot be negative, it means that the investor does nothing when the value of the portfolio is over the predefined target.
2. the investment can be either positive or negative, it means that the investor adds or withdraws from the portfolio in order to reach the predefined target.

## The method

1. Investment always positive (no withdraw)
> invest an of dollars in bitcoin on a **weekly** basis
>> at the close (fictive) of the second working day, *Tuesday* (arbitrary choice)  
>> start at the *first week of the year*  
>> end at the *last week of the year*  
>> **ajusted amount** for reaching an increment of **50 dollars** by week  

>> **never withdraw**

> compare with the amount put in a bank account instead (0% interest)

2. Investment with withdrawals (full adjustment)
> invest an amount of dollars in bitcoin on a **weekly** basis
>> at the close (fictive) of the second working day, *Tuesday* (arbitrary choice)  
>> start at the *first week of the year*  
>> end at the *last week of the year*  
>> **ajusted amount** for reaching ***strictly*** an increment of **50 dollars** by week 

> compare with the amount put in a bank account instead (0% interest)

> compare the number of bitcoins held over time for both versions
